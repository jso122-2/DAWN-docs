Here’s a full build-out of the **Invocation** section, expanding your
three bullets into a concrete spec + symbolic layer:
````markdown
## Invocation — How Sigils Are Cast
### Timing
- Sigils are not persistent processes.
- They are **cast at discrete ticks** — moments where DAWN chooses to
act symbolically, in response to pressure, entropy, or tracer feedback.
- Each invocation = one glyph event with parameters.
---
### Sources of Invocation
1. **Core Modules (automatic)**
- Invoked when SCUP metrics cross thresholds (e.g., pressure overload,
entropy spike).
- Example: Tick Engine triggers **Flame House: ignite_release** when P >
θ.
2. **Tracers (feedback)**
- Tracers may “speak” in sigils instead of raw metrics.
- Example: Spider issues a **Weaving House: reinforce_thread** sigil
when schema tension rises.
3. **Operator (manual/GUI)**
- Human overseer can trigger glyphs through symbolic console (visual or
text glyph).
- Example: operator invokes **Purification House: prune_cluster** to
clean soot.
---
### Stacking & Composition
- Sigils can be **layered in sequence** within the same tick.
- Stacking allows complex operations to be composed symbolically without
bespoke code.
- Examples:
- **Purification + Weaving** = prune → immediately reinforce surviving
connections.
- **Flame + Echo** = ignite burst → amplify into vocal resonance.
- **Memory + Mirror** = rebloom recall → audit coherence simultaneously.

### Syntax & Representation
Sigil invocations are stored/logged as composable JSON-like structures:
```json
{
"tick": 104233,
"invoker": "Core/Tracer/Operator",
"stack": [
{ "sigil": "purge_soot", "house": "purification", "params":
{"target_cluster": "X"} },
{ "sigil": "weave_thread", "house": "weaving", "params": {"source": "X",
"target": "Y"} }
]
}
````
---
### Operational Rules
* **One stack per tick** per invoker (avoids runaway recursion).
* **House compatibility** check: some sigils reinforce each other,
others conflict.
* **Conflict resolution**: SHI chooses which glyph dominates if stacked
sigils contradict.
* **Decay**: sigil effects shimmer like blooms — most expire in 3–10
ticks unless reinforced.
---
### Safeguards
* Prevents **sigil flood**: rate limit per tick.
* Prevents **drift**: Owl audits invocation logs, checks glyph → effect
consistency.
* Prevents **arbitrary stacking**: only Houses with defined
composability allowed.
```
⚡ This makes sigils feel like **active spellcasting inside DAWN** —
ephemeral, stackable, and tied to pressure + tracer triggers.
�� Do you want me to go deeper next into a **worked example** (e.g. a
“tick walkthrough” where Core pressure triggers a Flame sigil, Spider
adds Weaving, Owl mirrors — showing a whole stack in action)?
