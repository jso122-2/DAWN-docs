## Interactions
- **Core**
Sigils act as the *mythic grammar* for control: raw ops are never
executed naked, but wrapped in glyph form.
Example: instead of `rebloom()`, Core invokes **Memory House:
rebloom_flower** inside the Ring.
- **Bloom**
Juliet rebloom events are always expressed through the **House of
Memory**.
Each rebloom invocation is logged as a glyph event, visually tying bloom
mechanics to mythic metaphor.
- **Residue**
Ash/Soot transitions are routed through the **House of Purification**.
This ensures decay, pruning, and composting are narrated as ritual
cleansing rather than silent state changes.
- **Tracers**
Each tracer is aligned to a *signature sigil type*:
- Crow → Echo glyphs (resonance / anomaly cries)
- Owl → Mirror glyphs (reflection / audit)
- Bee → Weaving glyphs (pollination threads)
- Whale → Flame glyphs (deep ballast ignition)
- Beetle → Purification glyphs (recycling decay)
This alignment makes tracers active participants in symbolic routing,
not just data feeders.
- **GUI**
The Ring is rendered visually as a **circle of glyphs in orbit**.
Operators can see which Houses are active each tick and “read” system
state as a living ritual map — glyphs light up as they fire, threads
connect houses when sigils stack.

## Failure Modes
- **Sigil Drift**
Glyph meaning drifts away from underlying execution (e.g.
“rebloom_flower” sigil actually pruning by mistake).
*Impact:* operator trust erodes, symbolic layer collapses.
*Safeguards:* Owl audits every invocation for glyph → meaning → effect
consistency.
- **Over-Sigilization**
Too many symbolic wrappers obscure the underlying mechanics.
*Impact:* latency in ops, myth overload in GUI, hard to debug.
*Safeguards:* SHI tracks “sigil density per tick”; over-threshold glyphs
are collapsed to raw ops.
- **Broken House**
Conflicting sigils within the same House (e.g. Purification: ignite +
extinguish in one tick).
*Impact:* execution incoherence, schema contradiction.
*Safeguards:* Spider monitors intra-house tension, SHI aborts
conflicting stacks, fallback to Core ops.

## Safeguard Summary
- **SHI** → monitors symbolic coherence with a Sigil Health Index.
- **Owl** → long-memory auditor; logs glyph → meaning drift.
- **Spider** → web-tension sensor; flags intra-thread or intra-house
conflict.
