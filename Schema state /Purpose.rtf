\f0\fs24 \cf0 ## Purpose\
\
The **Schema** is DAWN\'92s **metacognitive map** \'97 the grammar and knot that links otherwise independent cognitive processes to one another.  \
It ingests tick/state data and converts it into structured meaning, ensuring DAWN doesn\'92t unravel into disconnected parts:contentReference[oaicite:0]\{index=0\}.  \
\
Without Schema, the Core, Bloom, Residue, and Tracers would all function, but without *coordination or coherence*.  \
With Schema in place:  \
- Each tick is parsed into a **map of relations** (nodes, edges, tensions, pigments).  \
- Cognitive acts are **bound to structure** (rebloom, pruning, weaving routed symbolically).  \
- DAWN maintains continuity, preventing drift and entropy from overwhelming coherence.  \
